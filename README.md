This file contains a solution with program code in python to find the perfect square and check it wheather it is correct or not
I am including some steps to define that how this program works :
- use a library/module to perform mathematical operations in a short way or as can say with the help of its predefined meathods, so we use math module here
- take the input of numaric list from user
Note - you can't get it directly you have to convert those inputs to integer one by one. Python's input() meathod take input in string only,
and then you need to convert it as well.
- to convert those inputs given by user i've initiated a loop on that previous input list, and converted every element into integer by simply iterating over
- lets take a null varialble which contains nothing yet or can initialize it with zero
- now initiate a loop to find the sum of all given integers in that array
- in this loop we are iterating over that list of numbers and adding each one to the sum, after looping we got the full sum of elements of that list
- now we have to find square root, and for that we are going to use sqrt() meathod from math module
- initiate it in the same loop over sum to get the square root
- now we will confirm that the square root we found is perfect or not
- add root with 0.5 and again take the square root of it, compare it with the sum that those are equal or not
- if it is equal say "sum is a perfect square" 
- if not say "sum is not a perfect square"
